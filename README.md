# LiveTagger

Ableton Live 12's new browser is really cool, but setting up the metadata for all of your existing samples is extremely tedious - especially since [there is no way to apply tags to an entire folder at once](https://ableton.centercode.com/project/feedback/view.html?cap=ea2ce822bd02401dba446c068717bc68&uf=e788c9befb6e46408e9ad7a0f7979a05).

LiveTagger is a utility which allows you to batch tag files from the command line.
